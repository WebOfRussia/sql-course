# Functions in SQL ðŸ”¢

In real-life SQL queries complexity often arises because they are used to handle multiple layers of aggregation, data transformations and formatting tasks within a single query. In such cases, SQL functions reduce processing time and keep SQL queries readable and maintainable.

ðŸ“– **SQL Functions** â€” built-in operations allowing to perform calculations, manipulate data, and retrieve specific information directly within your SQL queries.

They help streamline data processing and enhance query efficiency by eliminating the need for additional calculations. SQL provides a wide range of *built-in functions* that help performing operations on data. These functions are categorized into several types, depending on the kind of operations they perform. For example, if we want to lower case a string, we may use `LOWER` function:

```sql
SELECT LOWER("Hi, This is Lower Case Function");
```

# What is a Built-in Function? ðŸ¤”

<aside>

ðŸ“– **Built-in Function â€”** pre-defined function provided by the database system that performs a specific task or operation. These functions are integrated into the SQL language and are readily available for use without needing to write custom code.

*Built-in functions* take one or more *arguments/inputs*, process them and return a result. For example, you might use a *built-in function* to:

- Calculate the average of a numeric column â†’ `AVG()`
- Convert text to uppercase â†’ `UPPER()`
- Get the current date and time â†’ `NOW()`

```sql
SELECT
    NOW() AS curent_datetime,
    LENGHT("Hi. I'm learning SQL") AS str_length;
```

ðŸ’¡ Functions can be applied not only to literals but also to values retrieved from a table. 
In this case, the function processes each row individually.

For example, letâ€™s check out `client` table and do the following tasks:

1. Lowercase client name
2. Take only 5 first letters (assume we need it)

```sql
SELECT
    LEFT(LOWER(name), 5) AS client_name_low_first_5
FROM
    client;
```

# Type of Built-in Functions ðŸŽ¨

SQL functions can be broadly categorized into several types. Depending on your task and having the below table at hand you can quickly decide what you need:

| **Type**                | **Functions**                                     | **Example**                                                                                          |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| *Aggregate Functions*    | `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `MIN()`, `MAX()`    | `SUM(sales_amount)`<br>`MIN(price)`<br>`AVG(sales)`                                                 |
| *String Functions*       | `UPPER()`, `LOWER()`, `SUBSTRING()`, `LENGTH()`, `CONCAT()` | `LOWER(name)`<br>`CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name)`<br>`SUBSTRING(name, 1, 3)`                  |
| *Date and Time Functions*| `NOW()`, `DATEADD()`, `DATEDIFF()`, `YEAR()`, `MONTH()`, `DAY()` | `DATEADD(DAY, 7, order_date)`<br>`DATEDIFF(DAY, start_date, end_date)`<br>`DATEPART(QUARTER, sale_date)` |
| *Mathematical Functions* | `ROUND()`, `ABS()`, `POWER()`, `MOD()`           | `POWER(2, 3)` â†’ `8`<br>`MOD(10, 3)` â†’ `1`<br>`ABS(-23.5)` â†’ `23.5`                                   |
| *Conditional Functions*  | `CASE()`, `COALESCE()`, `NULLIF()`               | `COALESCE(email, 'No Email')`<br>`NULLIF(status, 'Inactive')`<br>`CASE WHEN sales > 100 THEN 'High' ELSE 'Low' END` |
