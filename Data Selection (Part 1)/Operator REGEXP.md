# Operator REGEXP üóíÔ∏è

Sometimes string columns might be so different and complex that even with operator `LIKE` you will be unable to solve your task. In this case you can use more advanced approach called *regular expressions*.

<aside>

üìñ `REGEX` is used to perform advanced pattern matching within string data.

It allows you to search for specific patterns, extract information or even replace certain parts of a string. While SQL itself provides some basic string matching tools like `LIKE`, `REGEXP` offers much more flexibility and power when working with complex patterns.

# REGEXP Logic üß©

Many SQL databases, such as *MySQL*, *PostgreSQL* and *Oracle* support *regular expressions*. The syntax might slightly differ, but the general idea is consistent. *Regular expressions* use a series of symbols to define patterns for searching within strings. 

```sql
-- REGEXP synatx
... WHERE table_field REGEXP 'pattern';
```

For example, in *‚ÄúAir Travel‚Äù* database we have different planes (e.g. *Boeing 737, Airbus A320, Bombardier CRJ900).* Let‚Äôs select only those records that have a plane that have only 3 numbers in name:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM planes
WHERE model REGEXP '[0-9]{3}';
```

# REGEXP or LIKE? ü§î

The `LIKE` operator is convenient for simple search patterns, such as finding strings that start or end with a specific set of characters or contain certain substrings. However, if more complex and flexible searching is required ‚Äî such as searching with multiple conditions or using special characters and ranges ‚Äî the `REGEXP` operator becomes an indispensable tool.

üí° Use `REGEXP` when complex and flexible searching is required!

# Regular Expression Syntax ‚öôÔ∏è

- **Case Insensitivity**
    - By default, regular expressions in are *case-insensitive*. The expression `REGEXP 'abc'` will find strings like `abc`, `Abc`, and `ABC`.
- **Escape Characters**
    - Certain characters have special meanings in regular expressions and require escaping (e.g. **, +, ?, [, ], (, ), {, }, |, \*). The backslash `\\` is used for escaping.

# Special Characters and Structures üìú

| **Characters/Structures** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| `*` | 0 or more instances of the preceding string |
| `+` | 1 or more instances of the preceding string |
| `.` | Any single character |
| `?` | 0 or 1 instance of the preceding string |
| `^` | Matches the beginning of the string |
| `$` | Matches the end of the string |
| `[abc]` | Any character listed in the brackets |
| `[^abc]` | Any character not listed in the brackets |
| `[A-Z]` | Matches any uppercase letter from the Latin and Cyrillic alphabets, respectively |
| `[a-z]` | Matches any lowercase letter from the Latin and Cyrillic alphabets, respectively |
| `[0-9]` | Matches any digit |
| `p1` | p2 |
| `{n}` | n instances of the preceding string |
| `{m, n}` | Between m and n instances of the preceding string |

# REGEXP Examples üß™

To get all users whose names start with *"John"*:

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM passenger
WHERE name REGEXP '^Jennifer';
```

The expression searches for strings that start with `Jennifer` The symbol `^` indicates the beginning of the string. Now let's retrieve all names that end with either letter `h` or `s` :

```sql
SELECT *
FROM flight
WHERE name REGEXP '[hs]$';
```

In this example, `[hs]` defines the list of possible values for the pattern, `$` indicates what the string should end with. Now, let's find all users that travelled either on `Boeing 737` or `Boeing 777` :

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM passenger
WHERE plane_name REGEXP 'Boeing (737|777)$';
```

# Important Notes ‚ö†Ô∏è

- `REGEXP` offers powerful search capabilities far beyond than `LIKE`
- *Regular expressions* are highly flexible, allowing complex search criteria like multiple conditions, ranges of characters or repeated patterns.
- While `REGEXP` can be very efficient, it can also be computationally expensive for large datasets, so use it wisely when performance is a concern.
