# **SQL Dialects (SQL Extensions) üåç**

While SQL is the universal language for relational database management systems, many *DBMSs* have their own unique variations and additions to the language, deviating from the standard. These variations are called dialects or extensions of the language.

Some examples:

- `T-SQL` ‚Äî Microsoft SQL Server dialect
- `PL/SQL` ‚Äî Oracle Database dialect
- `PL/pgSQL` ‚Äî PostgreSQL dialect

# **Which Dialect Should I Learn? ü§î**

If you are starting to learn SQL, it is recommended to master standard SQL. However, if you already know which specific database you will be working with, it is better to learn its dialect, since different databases may have some differences in syntax.

In our course, we will use the PostgreSQL since it is popular and uses a syntax close to standard SQL, with minor deviations.
