# Data Types for Table Columns

Each column in a table must have a specific *data type* that indicates what kind of information can be stored in that column. The *data type* of a column determines the operations that can be performed on the data, the amount of storage space required and how the data is stored internally.

SQL includes several common data types, including:

- *String Data Type* ðŸ†Ž
- *Numeric Data Type* ðŸ”¢
- *Boolean Data Type âœ…*
- *Date and Time* ðŸ“…

When defining a table in SQL, it is essential to choose the appropriate *data types* for each column to ensure efficient storage and retrieval of data. Additionally, it is important to consider the possible range of values that will be stored in each column and select a data type that corresponds to that range.
